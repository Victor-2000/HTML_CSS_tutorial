# 2.1 Your first Web Page

- <meta charset = "utf-8" /> Instructs the browser how to render specific characters
- <meta name = "value"> </meta> When there is not any text ment to be inbetween a tag, 
  it is common to put /> instead of ></tag> for example 
  (but /> is optional actually, you can just use >)

# 2.2 Finding a proper code editor

- It is always a best practice to explicitly specify what
  every content is (for ex. don't leave text without tags)
- <em></em> stands for emphasis tag (makes text italic)
- <strong></strong> makes text bold
- <p></p> separates text into paragraphs (gets them to a new line also)
- you can change default styles of any tag (by using CSS)

# 2.3 Lists

- <ul></ul> unordered list
- <ol></ol> ordered list
    - <li></li> list item (child of the 2 previous list tags)
- <dl></dl> definition list
    - <dt></dt> definition term (the child of definition list)
    - <dd></dd> definition (the child of definition list)
- identation is based on the concept of children - parent
  (child should be always one tab further than parent)
- the browser makes up for for bad coding (but not all all the time)

# 2.4 Parent-Child Relationships

- <span></span> simple wrapper which doesn't have any specific
  format (it is usually used to target specific text for CSS or
  JavaScript)

# 2.5 Headings

- There are 5 headings <h{here goes 1-5}>
  (priorities go descending from 1-5)

# 2.6 Block Quotes

- <blockquote></blockquote> shows that text is a block quote 
  it does not have any special style (but that can be changed in CSS)

# 2.7 Anchors

- <a href = "address"></a> this is an anchor (an anchor is basically)
  - <a target = "_blank"> an attribute of <a> which opens a new
    page in a new tab when clicked
- http://jeffrey-way.com useful website for learning web tech
- index.html from root directory is the default page which is
  first opened by the web host

# 3.1 Your First Stylesheet

- Most of the tags have style attributes which can accept CSS
  as input for the current tag. (you can change display style)
- CSS is usually represented in the shape "propertyName:
  propertyValue;"
- One CSS property is color. Color determines the color of
  the text. (you can have a predefined color (as yellow or
  black), an rgb/rgba (255,255,255,255{this one is the alpha)
  and an hex for example (#e3e3e3))
- text-decoration - that determines the type of decoration the
  text can have (can be underline or none)

- The best practice is to create a stylesheet and separate
  all the CSS from the HTML because otherwise it takes all
  the purpose of the html (solely describing the content)
- In CSS files it is important to specify the tag through this
  format "tagName{styleConfig}".
- font-family - can be multiple fonts (ex. helvetica,arial
  if helvetica is not available then the browser falls back to
  arial)
