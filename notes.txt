# 2.1 Your first Web Page

- <meta charset = "utf-8" /> Instructs the browser how to render specific characters
- <meta name = "value"> </meta> When there is not any text ment to be inbetween a tag, 
  it is common to put /> instead of ></tag> for example 
  (but /> is optional actually, you can just use >)

# 2.2 Finding a proper code editor

- It is always a best practice to explicitly specify what
  every content is (for ex. don't leave text without tags)
- <em></em> stands for emphasis tag (makes text italic)
- <strong></strong> makes text bold
- you can change default styles of any tag (by using CSS)
