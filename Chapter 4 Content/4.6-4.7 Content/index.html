            The number of web applications being created and used has grown
            rapidly since the new millenium. And importantly, so has the sheer
            complexity of them -- specially on the front end. No more static
            pages, no sir!

            You have a ton of sections each interacting with each other and the
            server and yes, it's as complicated as it sounds and just as hard to
            pull off. Today, I'd like to talk about a few choice JavaScript
            frameworks that aim to simplify front- end application development.
